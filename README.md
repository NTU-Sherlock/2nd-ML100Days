# 2nd-ML100Days
The Second 100DaysML started from April 2019 to August 2019. Participants persist in dedicating an hour a day learning Machine Learning concepts during Marathon.

This repositories contains the homework I have done in 2nd Machine Learning 100 Days Marathon. I hope my persistence ( I hope I do persist) can inspire you in learning this fascinating field.
